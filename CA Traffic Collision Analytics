#Here I downloaded a California Traffic Collision data set from Kaggle.


#1. First I explored the collisons table.
SELECT *
FROM switrs.collisions;

#2. I found the total number of collisions in LA.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM switrs.collisions
WHERE county_location = 'los angeles';

#3. I found the total number of collisons that occured on Route 405.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM switrs.collisions
WHERE primary_road = 'RT 405'
OR secondary_road = 'RT 405';

#4. Then I explored the parties table.
SELECT *
FROM switrs.parties;

#5. I found the total number collisons where a cellphone was in use during the collision.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM switrs.parties
WHERE cellphone_use_type LIKE '%cellphone in use%';

#6. I found the total number of collisions where the the driver at fault was under 20 years old.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM switrs.parties
WHERE party_age < 20
AND at_fault = 1;

#7. I found the age and sex of drivers involved in collisions that were drinking underage.
SELECT party_age, party_sex, party_sobriety
FROM switrs.parties
WHERE party_age < 21
AND party_sobriety LIKE '%under influence%';

#8.I found the age, sex, and location of drivers involved in fatal collisions.
SELECT party_sex, party_age, county_location
FROM switrs.parties
JOIN switrs.collisions
ON collisions.case_id = parties.case_id
WHERE collision_severity = 'fatal';
